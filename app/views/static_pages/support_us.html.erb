              <div class="text-sm">
                Your money will be used to pay for the costs of running The Odin Project. This includes paying for the servers that host the website, the domain name, and any other costs associated with running the project. Your money does <i>not</i> go towards paying the maintainers. All of our expenses are documented directly on the <%= link_to 'Open Collective website.', 'https://opencollective.com/theodinproject', class: 'text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300 font-semibold underline', target: '_blank' %>

                <br>
                If you're reading this in July or August of 2023, there is no expense data on Open Collective because we have not yet used any funds from donations there. As we receive donations, and use the money to pay for expenses, the expense data will be updated on Open Collective.

                Your donation helps us continue to provide a world-class and completely free coding curriculum for anyone and everyone eager to learn. We believe that this material should be available for free to anyone that needs it, and donations from those that have the means to contribute help keep it available for everyone!
                <br><br>
                In additon to the above, donors get a special 'backer' role in our discord server as a small bit of recognition.

            <li class="mb-8">
              <h3 class="text-lg mb-2">How do I get the 'backer' role on Discord?</h3>
              <div class="text-sm">
                Use the <code>/opencollective</code> command in our discord server to verify your Open Collective account. You will then be automatically given the 'backer' role.
                You will be prompted to provide your Open Collective username, which is found in the URL of your Open Collective profile. For example, if your profile URL is <code>https://opencollective.com/rick-astley</code> your username is <code>rick-astley</code>.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you want to remove the role for any reason, contact staff on discord through ModMail.

                No. The role is just a way for us to show our appreciation for your support.

              <h3 class="text-lg mb-2">Does becoming a donor mean I get priority support in the chat?</h3>
              <div class="text-sm">
                No. We feel strongly that everyone should be treated equally in our community, regardless of whether or not they are a donor.

                You can help us by <%= link_to 'contributing to our open source projects.', contributing_path, class: 'text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300 font-semibold underline', target: '_blank' %> You can also help us by spreading the word about The Odin Project.

              <h3 class="text-lg mb-2">What ever happend to Thinkful? Viking Code School?</h3>
              <div class="text-sm">
                When The Odin Project was created by Eric Trautman in 2013, it was primarily funded by Eric's other project, the for-profit Viking Code School. Eric wanted Odin to be free, and kept it that way by placing a small ad for Viking Code School on the website.
                <br> <br>
                In late 2017, Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful. As a part of that acquisition, Thinkful agreed to continue funding The Odin Project, in return for an ad on The Odin Project website.
                <br> <br>
                In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but supportive, and continued funding us the entire time. However we began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become self-funding, to avoid the risk of being acquired by a company that might not be as supportive.
                <br> <br>
                In 2023, we decided to begin the process of parting ways with Chegg, and become self-funding. We are now funded entirely by donations.
